Nowadays you are surely listening to various AI technologies such as ChatGpt, Bard, Bing chat and many more. But starting from zero, what do you mean by artificial intelligence?

Let's look at the most common definition given by our favourite Wikipedia:

> **Artificial intelligence** (**AI**) is intelligence — perceiving, synthesizing, and inferring information — demonstrated by machines, as opposed to intelligence displayed by non-human animals and humans.

So, in common and simple terms artificial intelligence is a non-human technology where machines and software are trained based on datasets and tries to give you an output based on the data provided by you.

In short words, AI works just like our human brain…. Takes an input, processes the data, and provides you with an efficient output based on data.

Yes, you’re thinking correctly that if AI works just like a human brain, then definitely it has good outcomes as well as bad outcomes. In brief, I can say that either it would be virtuous or it would be evil.

### Starting of Era: Yesterday

Have you ever thought that from where the term AI comes from?

The term “Artificial Intelligence” was coined by Nathaniel Rochester and Claude E. Shannon in 1956. Later on, this theory was joined by Marvin Minsky and John McCarthy in 1959. John McCarthy was one of the most influential people in the field. He is also known as the “father of artificial intelligence” because of his fantastic work in Computer Science and AI.

This doesn’t mean that before this people were not aware of AI. There was one more person named Alan Turing who gave us the foundation and theory of AI. He did some of the first significant work in artificial intelligence in the middle of the 20th century. He and John McCarthy with Marvin Minsky, Allen Newell, and Herbert A. Simon created expectational theory and applications of artificial intelligence.

### Creating a new technology stream: Today

Today, AI is creating new market areas and becoming popular in the technological world. AI like ChatGpt has created an ample number of applications in this field. We can create anything with these tools such as art, blogs (not this one), web landing pages, android applications and many more. Here are a few AI generated Images I created:

So, there are basically two types of AI:

1. Weak or narrow Artificial Intelligence
    
2. Strong Artificial Intelligence
    

Weak AI, also called Narrow AI or Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI) — is AI trained and focused to perform specific tasks. Weak AI drives most of the AI that surrounds us today. Weak AI lacks human consciousness, although it may be able to simulate it at times. Examples are Apple’s Siri, Amazon’s Alexa, IBM Watson, and autonomous vehicles.

Strong AI is made up of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI). Artificial general intelligence (AGI), or general AI, is a theoretical form of AI where a machine would have an intelligence equal to humans; it would have a self-aware consciousness that can solve problems, learn, and plan for the future. Strong artificial intelligence is more of a philosophy rather than an actual approach to creating AI. It is a different perception of AI, where it competes with human intelligence. Examples are HAL, the superhuman, rogue computer assistant in *2001:* A Space Odyssey and the famous JARVIS from Iron Man movies.

Today there are many applications of AI such as Chatbots, Machine Learning Software, and Autonomous Vehicles. AI in education today Automated document reading, grading, and plagiarism checking powered by artificial intelligence are helping to ease the workload of educators, and providing an additional viewpoint to that of human instructors. At the urban level, an evolving set of “smart city” technologies are beginning to live up to their promise of optimizing utility provision, traffic control, waste management, and other essential services.

### Future predictions and possibilities: Tomorrow

Artificial intelligence is shaping the future of humanity across nearly every industry. It is already the main driver of emerging technologies like big data, robotics and IoT. In Mendelson’s view, some of the most intriguing AI research and experimentation that will have near-future ramifications is happening in two areas: “reinforcement” learning, which deals in rewards and punishment rather than labelled data; and generative adversarial networks that allow computer algorithms to create rather than merely assess by pitting two nets against each other.

A new report by Grand View Research projects that the global artificial intelligence market will reach USD 390.9 billion by 2025. According to the forecast, the market will grow at a CAGR of 46.2% by the year 2025.

## Conclusion:

AI has a great future and will create a mass impact on technological industries. Everything has its advantages and disadvantages, and so does AI but it’s our responsibility to deal with these technologies because if used positively they will have boon causes whereas negatively they will have bane causes.
