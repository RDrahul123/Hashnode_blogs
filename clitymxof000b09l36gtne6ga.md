Nowadays technologies are expanding and to some extent, we are all aware of blockchain and big data. So fundamentally what happens when these two amazing technologies come together and act as one? I bet the results we achieve are astonishing and formidable.

So, what is blockchain in brief?

Blockchain is a shared, distributed ledger that records transactions across business networks with the aim of helping businesses remove inefficiencies from trade. It does this through the use of cryptographic proofs, which help engender trust by ensuring facts are reported consistently to all those with a need to see them. Think of a database that instead of storing all the database entries on one computer stores the data on multiple computers. Each block contains records and transactions; these blocks are shared across multiple computers and should not be altered absent an agreement (consensus) of the entire network.

1\. Blockchain Technology

Now we know what blockchain is and how it works but what about big data?

So, basically the term “Big Data” has become popular, there is no general consensus about what it really means. Often, many professional data analysts would imply the process of extraction, transformation, and load (ETL) for large datasets as the connotation of Big Data. Big data is the capability to manage a huge volume of disparate data, at the right speed, and within the right time frame to allow real-time analysis and reaction.

2\. File size of data from different sources

Let’s now discuss their amalgamation...

Big data analytics processes are provided in the form of both industry and academia. It operates and manages its own data in Blockchain technology. Blockchain systems ensure the privacy and integrity of data, it predicts a large amount of data in big data techniques but focus on validating data, the data to be brought together in a decentralized manner and the origin of the data linked in a chained manner.

**BLOCKCHAIN SERVICES FOR BIG DATA**

*1\.* **Blockchain for Big Data Acquisition:** In general, big data applications acquire data from diversified sources in a different format (unstructured data). These data cannot be processed in the native form. Therefore, the data must be converted to a structured format from which various predictions on the application domain can be made.

· Blockchain for Secure Big Data Collection

· Blockchain for Secure Big Data Transmission/Sharing

***2\.* Blockchain for Big Data Storage:** There are several cloud-based services available to store and access files from anywhere on any machine. Users, particularly organizations, are hesitant to store sensitive information on a system managed by a third party.

· Blockchain for Secure File Systems

· Blockchain for Secure Database Management

**3\. Blockchain for Big Data Analytics:** The development of edge and cloud computing has increased the amount of data in various scenarios. The extensive construction and generation of data from sensors, social media, web and IoT devices resulted in the growth of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques.

· Blockchain for Secure Data Learning in AI Algorithms

· Blockchain for Secure Data Training

Integration of blockchain and bigdata

Conclusion:

Definitely, it would be our biggest advantage if we combine both technologies and use them. There will be plenty of applications and use cases. Today, security is the factor that a developer confirms and a customer wants so enabling blockchain in big data would create a mass impact on data integrity and confidentiality.
